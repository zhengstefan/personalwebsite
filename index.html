      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p>
        Growing up in in a non-academic migrant family, I recognized early what key importance the economic prosperity of a society has for coping social challenges. My parents are Chinese immigrants who came to Germany about thirty years ago with
        only
        a low level of education and scarce financial means. Thanks to a German society based on equal opportunities, I was not only able to grow up in sheltered surroundings and successfully graduate from high school as the valedictorian - I was
        even
        supported by several scholarships during my studies of Industrial Engineering at the Technical University of Darmstadt. Grateful for the privileges I have received, it is a great concern of mine to contribute to a society of opportunity as
        well
        as to repay many times over what I have received from society. In my future professional life, I plan to do so by solving the challenges of internationally active corporations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Starting next fall, I will complete internships at Bain & Company, Audi Consulting, Deutsche Telekom Center Strategic Projects and FC Bayern Munich as a part of a gap year program.
